  "egyHandContent1": "Handicrafts are unique expressions that represent the traditions and heritage of a community and their importance lies in both their cultural and aesthetic value. Egypt’s rich and diverse cultural heritage is reflected in the scope and breadth of its crafts which span from Siwa in the west steeped in amazigh culture to Sinai in the east with its Bedouin origins; from Aswan in the south, home to Nubian culture, to the mediterranean coast in the north, with historic Cairo in the midst of Egypt's cultural diversity which has been largely influenced by the various eras of the Islamic period.",
  "egyHandContent2": "The handicrafts sector has faced many challenges, the most devastating being the encroachment of industrial modernization. Yet, key surviving crafts remain including: woodwork such as wood turning (arabesque), carving and inlay with various materials, embroidery, pottery and ceramics, traditional patchwork (khayameya), jewellery and accessories, basketry and other products using palm fronds, leather products, brass shaping, etching and engraving, textile weaving, woven and knotted carpets and glass blowing.",
